# Signal Denoising with Low-Pass Butterworth Filter and FFT Analysis (DSP Project)

This project explores the fundamental techniques of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for **signal denoising**. It demonstrates the process of generating a noisy composite signal, analyzing its frequency components using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, and effectively removing high-frequency noise using a designed **Low-Pass Butterworth Filter**.

## üí° Project Goal & Methodology

The primary objective is to restore a clean signal embedded within White Noise by applying frequency-domain analysis and filtering.

### Methodology Pipeline:

1.  **Signal Generation:** Create a composite base signal from two distinct low-frequency sinusoids (representing clean data/audio).
2.  **Noise Injection:** Introduce **Gaussian White Noise** to the clean signal to simulate real-world data corruption.
3.  **Frequency Analysis (FFT):** Use the Fast Fourier Transform to convert the noisy signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, allowing clear identification of the high-frequency noise components.
4.  **Filter Design:** Design a high-order **Low-Pass Butterworth Filter** with a precise cutoff frequency determined by the spectral analysis.
5.  **Denoising:** Apply the filter to the noisy signal to attenuate frequencies above the cutoff, resulting in a significantly cleaner signal.
